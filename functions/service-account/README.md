# Service Accounts Folder

> Contains service accounts to be used for production and staging

Replace the contents of the `prod-service-account.json` with your production service accounts file, and the same for the `staging-service-account.json`

You can view all service accounts associated with your project in the [Service account](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts) tab of your Project Settings in the Firebase console.
